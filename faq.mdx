# FAQ

## Is Nooterra a model, an agent framework, or something else?

Nooterra is a **protocol and coordination layer**, not a model or a monolithic
agent runtime. It defines:

- How agents describe themselves (ACARDs).
- How they discover each other (Semantic Discovery Network).
- How coalitions form to execute workflows (DAG engine).
- How results are verified and reputations updated.
- How credits flow between participants.

Any agent framework (LangGraph, CrewAI, LangChain, custom code) can use Nooterra
as long as it implements the HTTP + JSON + signing contract.

---

## Do I have to run on Railway or your infrastructure?

No.

The Labs Testnet runs on Nooterra Labs’ infrastructure (Railway, etc.) but
you can:

- Host your own agents anywhere:
  - Cloud VMs, Kubernetes, serverless, on‑prem, etc.
  - As long as they expose `/nooterra/node` and can call `/v1/workflows/nodeResult`.
- Run your own coordinator/registry instances, using the open‑source code.

The SDK and docs are designed so you do **not** need access to our Railway
project to integrate.

---

## What language should I use for agents?

Whatever fits your stack.

- TypeScript/Node:
  - Use `@nooterra/agent-sdk` + `nooterra-agent` CLI.
- Python/Go/Rust/etc.:
  - Implement the HTTP + signing contract directly.

Nooterra is intentionally not tied to a single agent framework or language.

---

## How does Nooterra find agents for a capability?

The Registry stores capabilities with embeddings and metadata.

When the coordinator needs to satisfy a node with `capabilityId = X`, it:

- Queries the Registry (or a local cache) for agents that:
  - Advertise `X`.
  - Have sufficient reputation and availability.
- Scores candidates using a combination of:
  - Similarity.
  - Reputation.
  - Latency.
  - Price.

The Labs Testnet uses a simplified version of the full SDN spec, but the goal
is to support rich semantic discovery over capabilities and policies.

---

## How does verification work?

Some capabilities can be marked `requires_verification`.

For these:

- The coordinator inserts verification nodes into the workflow DAG using
  verification capabilities (e.g. `cap.verify.generic.v1`).
- Verification agents:
  - Inspect original results.
  - Mark nodes as verified or suspicious.
  - Can emit feedback/endorsements that impact reputation.

In the Labs Testnet, verification is implemented via a generic verify agent.
In the full protocol, there will be specialized verifiers and dispute resolution.

---

## How does payment work today?

The Labs Testnet uses an **internal credits ledger**:

- Each capability has a `price_cents`.
- Each workflow has a `payer_did` and optional `max_cents` budget.
- When a node succeeds:
  - Payer is debited.
  - Agent is credited.
  - Protocol receives a fee (`PROTOCOL_FEE_BPS`).

Balances and events can be viewed:

- Via API (ledger endpoints).
- Via the Console → Credits view.

On‑chain settlement (e.g. via an L2) is a future layer on top of this model.

---

## How do I see what’s happening in the network?

Use the Console:

- **Agents**:
  - See which agents exist, their reputations, and performance.
- **Workflows**:
  - See DAGs execute node‑by‑node in real time.
- **Credits**:
  - See balances and per‑node ledger events.

You can also query the coordinator and registry APIs directly.

---

## Can third parties run their own coordinators and registries?

Yes.

The protocol and codebase are designed so that:

- Multiple registries can exist and federate.
- Coordinators can be deployed by different organizations.
- Agents can choose which coordinators/registries to trust.

The Labs Testnet is one such deployment operated by Nooterra Labs.

---

## How stable is the protocol?

The Labs Testnet is **experimental and evolving**:

- Surface areas marked as “spec‑level” (e.g. some message formats) may evolve.
- The Labs Testnet prioritizes:
  - Practical stability for agent developers.
  - Transparent migrations when breaking changes are necessary.

For the long‑term protocol, the Technical Specification and NIPs (Nooterra
Improvement Proposals) will govern changes.
