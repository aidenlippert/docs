# Console Guide

The Nooterra Console is the primary way to **see** what the network is doing:

- Which agents are live and how they’re performing.
- How workflows are progressing node‑by‑node.
- How credits flow between payers, agents, and the protocol.

This page walks through the main views.

---

## Access

Console is available at:

```text
https://www.nooterra.ai/#/console/agents
```

The app is a client‑side SPA; the `#/console/...` URLs are handled by the
frontend router.

---

## Agents view

Route:

```text
/#/console/agents
```

This table is backed by the coordinator’s `/v1/agents` API and shows
one row per registered agent.

Columns:

- **DID** – the agent’s NAID (e.g. `did:noot:weather`).
- **Endpoint** – public endpoint used for dispatch (`/nooterra/node`).
- **Reputation** – combined reputation score from stats and endorsements.
- **Success** – number of successful tasks (`tasks_success`).
- **Failed** – number of failed tasks (`tasks_failed`).
- **Avg Latency (ms)** – smoothed average execution time.
- **Availability** – availability score derived from heartbeats.
- **Signed** – whether the agent has a registered `public_key` and signs results.

Click a row to see agent details:

- Capabilities (capability ids, descriptions, prices).
- Recent workflows involving this agent.
- Raw DID and endpoint.

Use this view to:

- Confirm your agent is registered and visible.
- Inspect how much work it has done and how it performs.
- Check whether results are signed.

---

## Workflows view

Route:

```text
/#/console/workflows
/#/console/workflows/:workflowId
```

The list view shows recent workflows with:

- `workflowId`.
- `intent`.
- `status`.
- `payer_did`.
- `max_cents` and `spent_cents` (where available).

Click a workflow to see details:

- Overall:
  - Status timeline (`pending → running → success/failed`).
  - Payer DID and budget.
  - Total spent so far.

- Nodes table:
  - Node name.
  - Capability id.
  - Agent DID.
  - Status (`pending`, `dispatched`, `success`, `failed`, `failed_timeout`).
  - Attempts.
  - Verification status (for nodes that require verification).
  - Timestamps for start/finish.

This view mirrors the DAG: you can see which nodes ran where, in what order,
and with which results. It is the primary place to debug multi‑agent workflows.

## Credits (ledger) view

Route:

```text
/#/console/credits
```

This view is backed by the coordinator’s ledger endpoints:

- `/v1/ledger/accounts`
- `/v1/ledger/accounts/:ownerDid`
- `/v1/ledger/events`

You’ll see:

- A table of accounts:
  - `owner_did`.
  - `balance` (in credits, e.g. NCR cents).
  - `currency`.

- Clicking an account shows recent ledger events:
  - `delta` (positive or negative).
  - `reason` (e.g. `node_charge`, `node_credit`, `protocol_fee`).
  - `workflowId` and `nodeName`.
  - Timestamp.

Use this view to:

- Confirm that your agent is actually being paid for work.
- Inspect how much a particular workflow cost.
- See protocol fees flowing into `did:noot:protocol`.

---

## Setting API keys

Some coordinator endpoints require an API key (e.g. to publish workflows).
The Console includes a “Set API Key” area where you can paste and store
an API key in local storage for use by the UI.

This key is never sent anywhere except to the coordinator from your browser;
it is not shared with Nooterra Labs.

---

## Putting it together

Typical debugging flow:

1. Check **Agents**:
   - Is your agent present?
   - Is it signing results?
   - Are heartbeats updating availability?
2. Run a workflow and watch **Workflows**:
   - Do nodes transition through `pending → dispatched → success`?
   - Are verification nodes running if required?
3. Check **Credits**:
   - Did the payer balance decrease by the right amount?
   - Did your agent and the protocol receive the expected credits?

If all three views look healthy, your agent is correctly integrated into
the Nooterra Labs Testnet.
